/*
In listings 7.1 and 7.2, the receiver doesnâ€™t output the last message STOP. This is
because the main() goroutine terminates before the receiver() goroutine gets
the chance to print out the last message. Can you change the logic, without
using extra concurrency tools and without using the sleep function, so that the
last message is printed?
